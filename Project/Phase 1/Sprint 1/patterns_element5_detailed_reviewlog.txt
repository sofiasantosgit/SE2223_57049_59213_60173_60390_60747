Design Pattern: Decorator Pattern

Not sure if this is a Decorator Pattern.
-> The concrete decorators CalendarActivityImpl and CalendarEvent aren't subclasses of the base decorator GPCalendarBase. 
-> If GPCalendarBase implements GPCalendarCalc, then that should be the component interface, and there should be code snippets of it.

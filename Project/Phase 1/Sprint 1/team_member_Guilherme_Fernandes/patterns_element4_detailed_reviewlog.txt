Design Pattern: Singleton Pattern

-> All code snippets should have a label identifying their exact location on the codebase.

-> The explanation as for why it's a Singleton is not enough. There should be an explanation about how the "myUIConfig" is this class' uniqueInstance, and that clients access the sole instance of UIConfiguration only using its access point "getUIConfiguration".
